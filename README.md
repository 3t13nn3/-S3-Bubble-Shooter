# -S3-Bubble-Shooter

A Bubble Shooter game made with Java & JavaFX as part of a university project. This was my first Java GUI project.

If you are a french speaker, I invite you to go see the code comments.

## Prerequisites

- [JavaJDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or upper
- [JavaFX 8](https://openjfx.io/) or upper

## How to use - *Cross Platform Project*

### Compilation

**Linux & MacOS**

Compile the program with ```make``` to get ```.class```.

Compile the program with ```make jar``` to get a ```.jar``` executable without ```.class```.

Clean object ```.class``` or ```.jar``` by ```make clean```.

**Windows**

Into the ```Windows``` folder (you can double clik the file or use the name the concerned file as a command into the terminal):
* Compile the program with the ```Make.bat``` to get ```.class```.

* Compile the program with the ```MakeJar.bat``` to get a ```.jar``` without ```.class```.

* Clean object ```.class``` or ```.jar``` by ```Clean.bat```.

### Lauching

To lauch the program with ```.class``` files, use ```java Game```.

To lauch the program with ```.jar``` file, use ```java -jar BubbleShooter.jar```.

### Gameplay

You only have to click on the position you want your ball to go. There must be at least 3 glued bubbles to explose them (Note that the more bubbles exploded in a shot, the more points are won).

The game is over when they are no bubble anymore.

You can restart a game by the *```Restart```* button and quit by the *```Stop```* button.
